        I am Yinxuan Du and I go for Nora. I am currently a second year CS student from Warren college! I am passionate about competitive programming, CS education and entrepreneurship. I don’t have a very clear plan for the future yet, but I am very interested in trying a variety of options. Looking forward to working with everyone else!

        I’m Joshua Zhu, a second year CS major from Sixth! I enjoy baking, competitive video games, and am willing to pick up anything if it’s fun! As for the future, I have no idea what I want to do - but hopefully with the different things I’m learning, I will find that special thing for me.

        Hi, this is Hugo. I’m a 3rd year student majoring in CS from Muir. I’m born and raised in China. I’m excited to have the opportunity to work with everyone here. I did experience some levels of social death in the past while working on the school stuff alone. Yeah, after this class, I hope everyone can have one more great project on our resume for us to hunt for an internship.
