# Group Contract
## What is expected on the team:
- expected for everyone to download slack as a desktop / mobile app, and turn on notifications for those.
- If you can't do something, or something comes up (like exams, major assignments, etc.), it is expected of you to communicate with everyone what's going on 3 days in advance.
## What will happen if "Rules" are not followed:
- For a major assignment, then after the first time we will let Sanat know who isn't being responsible.
- If unresponsive for 3 times for general communication, then we let Sanat know, and he will dock points accordingly.
- Regardless, the rest of the group will know what you did and didn't do. Please stay on top of things!
